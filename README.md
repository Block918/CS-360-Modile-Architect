In this app I created a calendar app that we can keep track of day to day tasks. This app also has a login feature for privacy to anyone opening the app that doesn't have login credentials. We have a couple screens a login screen the calendar screen and a notification screen. UI is made to keep it simple for the user to move around the app with out being confused. Coding this app was the difficult part for me and it is not prefect and I do want to keep working on it to make it better. Testing the code was done by using andriod studio. I think the most successful part of my app is the login page I think it turned out to be the best part of my application so far.
